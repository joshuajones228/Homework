## **1.** What does one need to do to use a module?
A. You have to import it. The best way is to import the module and use the convention shorthand for it. 

> I.E. `import pandas as pd` 

You can also search for modules and packages you need [here](https://pypi.org/)

## **2.** Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.
Let's use the example from above.

> `import pandas as pd`

>`df = (your_csv_here.csv, args)`
>`df.columns #this will show the columns in your dataframe`

## **3.** What is a benefit of using Exception handling?
Exception handling is great because it allows your code to still execute in spite of errors. 

An good example is the `ZeroDivisionError` in python, that will throw an error when you try to divide by 0, but will not break your code for the user.

## **4.** What are the 4 components used for Python Exception Handling?
they are: 
- try 
- except
- else 
- finally

## **10.** What is the shape of NumPy arrays?
## **11.** What is a Tensor?
## **12.** Name a reason why it's better using NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?
## **13.** When creating an "empty" array, where do the elements come from?
