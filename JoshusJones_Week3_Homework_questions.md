# Homework week 3
## Homework Questions
**1. What is an algorithm?**
<p> An algorithm is basically a set of procedures or rules that a computer follows to solve a particular problem. A simple example could be 10%3 in python, would give you a remainder of 1. A more complex example would be a set of functions
inside a function to solve a particular problem. </p>
**2. Name 2 variables characters that variables cannot start with.**
<p>The first one is an integer. Variables in python cannot start with an intger. Another would be an escape character, like this \ /</p>
**3. What is a semantic error?**
<p>A semantic error is when no error message is genereted, but your program won't do the right thing. It does what you told it to do, not what you intended it to do </p>
**4. What is the number #1 rule of coding/debugging?**
<p> I remember what James said to do. He said to try to solve the problem yourself for between 20 mins and 1 hour. If that doesn't work, ask your co-worker, if that doesn't work, ask your boss. Another good assumption is that it's always your fault, you probably did something wrong if the program is not working. Some other useful tips I saw online were, quit thinking and look, also understand the system, meaning to put it through some tests. </p>
