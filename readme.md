 [I like animals] (file:///C:/Users/artif/Downloads/me%20with%20parrot.jpg)
 <p>One of my dreams is to retire in the country somewhere with animals, and just tend to them, maybe I'll sell animal products or have a garden stall or something, something simple. This parrot makes me think of that because whenever I am able to be around animals in this way, I'm immediately in a better mood. The inspiration is that this career path should help me realize a dream like this sooner.</p>
