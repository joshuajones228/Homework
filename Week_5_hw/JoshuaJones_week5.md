### **4.** To permanently sort a DataFrame, which keyword should one use with the `df.sort()` method?
You would utilize `inplace = True`

### **5.** What is a CSV?
It stands for comma separated value. Simply put it uses commas to separte values in a file. It stores tabular data with plain text.


### **6.** When cleaning data what values do we not like in our data
Best I can gather is you want columns to be the same data type. If you want to compare different data columns you want the comparisons to be the same type of data. For example, comparing floats to floats. Also it seems like you can do more with numerical data, from a coding perspective.

Consistency is more important than most things I'd aruge. If it's null is it consistently null? That's better than one null value here, a wrong format there, a wrong dtype there, etc.

Columns should also be of the same data types.
